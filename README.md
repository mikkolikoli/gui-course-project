This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project overview

This is a project for the course "Creating Graphical User Interfaces" at Tampere university. The project idea was completely up to us.
This project has been done in collaboration with Roosa Hekkala, who did the UI for the app.

The project has been designed for desktop use and doesn't include responsive design.

### Project idea

An app to plan your workouts. The user can choose either HIIT-style workouts or conventional workouts. On the main page there will be a calendar, where the user can look at their workouts for the day, the week or the month. On a given day the user can add one or multiple workouts or mark it as a rest day.

There will also be a possibility to have a HIIT timer that shows you the current exercise and the time remaining. This should be easily readable as we can expect that the user will use the app when doing their workout and move while looking at the screen.
